# Advent Of Code 2022
This repository contains my solutions for Advent Of Code 2022. It contains code in both Java and Haskell, 
Java because I am really familiar with it and is the language I use the most in my university, 
and Haskell because one of my teachers challenged us to do this in Haskell.
